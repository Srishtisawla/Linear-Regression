Introduction: 

This linear regression project focuses on the correlation between the two main variables,
the age of the respondent and also the religious observance (in hours) the respondent spends per week. 
We wanted to see if there was any correlation what so ever in age and religious observance while attending college. 
By conducting surveys and gathering data we were able to come to a conclusion on the correlation of the two variables. 

Population: Georgia College Students

Expected Findings: We expect there to be a rather weak negative correlation due to the fact that as students get older
and more removed from their structured houses and parents they fall out of touch with their spiritual side.
(AKA Attending church)

Main Variables: Age(x variable), Religious Observance Per Week(y variable)

Other Variables: Gender, Class, Religion, Times of Prayer Per Day, Hours Per Week w/Other Spiritual Affairs, Meditation

Methods: 

Through the use of StatCrunch,our group established a survey that we used to collect our data by randomly sampling students
across all ages, genders, races, and religions who attend Georgia College.
Once we conducted our surveys we used the data to develop our different statistics and correlation 
that surrounded our two main variables; age and religious observance. 
Age was a simple statisitc that required no method to achieve its value. 
Religious observance was calculated by adding together the respondents' hours spent on various religious activites. 
This number was determined to be by the week since most of our questions were based off of a per week basis.
